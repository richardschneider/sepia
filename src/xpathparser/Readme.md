Thanks to [Sergy Dubinets](https://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/SergeyDubinets) for the original bits on [Codeplex](https://xpathparser.codeplex.com/). 

[`Sepia Schematron`](./Source/Sepia/Schematron/) uses this library to rewrite XPath 2 expressions into XPath 1.  This allows Sepia Schematron to process many XPath2 expressions.

**TODO** - the XPath2 that are not supported.
